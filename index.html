    <h1>Hello my name is Nick</h1>
    <p>A few things about me</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before codeworks I worked for Budweiser and Fatty's Bar</li>
        <li>I'm looking forward to not working 7 days a week moving forward</li>
        <li>I just got back from a week long camping trip</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Week 2- At the beginning of this week I only knew how to create a new document and put a H1 title with a p tag or
        list below it. Now I can confidently setup the basic structure of the rest of the page understanding how
        everything fits inside one another such as the container, row, column order. I've also learned how to create
        buttons that actually do things in Javascript.</p>
